            "OBJECTIVE\tWe tested the assumption that , in humans , folic acid is biotransformed ( reduced and methylated ) to @-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa .\n",
            "METHODS\tWe conducted a crossover study in which we sampled portal and peripheral veins for labeled folate concentrations after oral ingestion with physiologic doses of stable-isotope-labeled folic acid or the reduced folate @-formyltetrahydrofolic acid ( @-FormylTHF ) in @ subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt ( TIPSS ) in situ .\n",

            "CONCLUSIONS\tThe human gut appears to have a very efficient capacity to convert reduced dietary folates to @-MTHF but limited ability to reduce folic acid .\n",
            "CONCLUSIONS\tTherefore , large amounts of unmodified folic acid in the portal vein are probably attributable to an extremely limited mucosal cell dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) capacity that is necessary to produce tetrahydrofolic acid before sequential methylation to @-MTHF .\n",
            "CONCLUSIONS\tThis process would suggest that humans are reliant on the liver for folic acid reduction even though it has a low and highly variable DHFR activity .\n",
